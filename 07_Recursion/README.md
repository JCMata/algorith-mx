## Topic: Recursion

### Overview

In mathematics, _Recursion (Recursivity, Recursiveness)_ is when a concept is defined in terms of itself or of its type and depends on smaller instances of the same concept (oppose of iteration) following two properties:

* A **base case** -  a scenario when the definition ends and does not use recursion to produce an answer.

* A **set of rules** - logic to reduce all the cases (except the simplest) toward the base case.

```
"The power of recursion evidently lies in the possibility of defining an infinite set of objects by a finite statement. In the same manner, an infinite number of computations can be described by a finite recursive program, even if this program contains no explicit repetitions."

- Wirth, Niklaus
```



### Implementations

Recursion can be implemented in mathematic operations such as factorial, fibonacci series and more complex situations using *functional programming* to improve performance and maintainability to the code.

Divide-and-conquer approach to solve big problems by dividing them in small pieces that in this case, simplify the logic to call *x* times *y* code.

#### Mathematics
There are some math functions that can be implementd by recursion:

##### Natural numbers

```
0 is N
if n is in N, then n + 1 is in N
```



##### Fibonacci series

```
For all integers n > 1, Fib(n) := Fib(n - 1) + Fib(n - 2).
```



##### Factorial

```
n! = { 1                  if n = 0
       (n - 1)! x n       if n > 0
```

```javascript
/** -------------------- NO RECURSION -------------------- **/

function factorial(num)
{
    // If the number is less than 0, reject it.
    if (num < 0) {
        return -1;
    }
    // If the number is 0, its factorial is 1.
    else if (num == 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    var acc = num;
    while (num-- > 2) {
        acc *= num;
    }
    return acc;
}

var result = factorial(8);

// Output: 40320
```

```javascript
/** ------------------- USING RECURSION ------------------- **/

function factorial(num)
{
    // If the number is less than 0, reject it.
    if (num < 0) {
        return -1;
    }
    // If the number is 0, its factorial is 1.
    else if (num == 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    // Otherwise, call this recursive procedure again.
    else {
        return (num * factorial(num - 1));
    }
}

var result = factorial(8);

// Output: 40320
```

### Problems

Given a nested array, write a function to flat it.

```
deffinition:   array[] = [1,2,[3,[4,5],6],7];
output:        // [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
```

### Extra Problem

As an Oxxo worker, I need to determine the number of ways
in which I can return change. I will be given the amount to
be returned and the denominations of the coins.

Sample Input and Output
```
amount: 4
coins : [1,2]
output: 3 ([1,1,1,1],[1,1,2],[2,2])
```
