## Topic: HashTables

### Task:

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

### Input Example:
```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
```
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,

### Output Expected:

```
return [0, 1].
```

### Assumptions
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
